# Polynomial-Conic-Optimization-Solver_MPC
This solver solves univariate polynomial conic optimizaiton via its dual, this is moment conic optimization in Chebyshev basis. 
The solver uses a type of non-symmetric homogeneous self-dual predictor-corrector interior point method to solve 
the moment conic optimization. 

The solver needs drsolve package to be in the path. "drsolve" is a matlab package that solves Hankel/Toeplitz or Hankel+Toeplitz systems 
in a stable and fast way.
